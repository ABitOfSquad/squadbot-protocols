# squadbot-protocols
All official protocol for squadbot, maintained and reviewed by the ABitOfSquad team.

## Contributing
If you would like to submit a protocol to squadbot, you can use the ``whatsapp`` protocol as your documentation. We aren't planning on writing an official documentation for Protocol Developers yet, our writers. The steps of submitting a protocol are quite simple.

To be a protocol, you create a directory with the name of your protocol. Only alphanumeric symbols! This folder should contain ``settings.json`` and ``protocol.js``. Dependencies can be added to a temporarily ``_protocol.json`` in the folder, so we can port this to our database on submission. 

1. Fork this repository
2. Submit a pull request, and give it the ``WIP`` label.
2. Wait for either ``boltgolt`` or ``nick vernij`` to give an approval of being an official protocol, we do this because of legal issues.
3. Happy coding!
4. Remove the ``WIP`` tag, and add ``Beta testing``, so we can get into the process of debugging your protocol.
